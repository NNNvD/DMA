# 🐉 Dungeon Master Assistant (DMA)

The Dungeon Master Assistant (DMA) is an LLM-powered co-DM for tabletop RPGs, ready to join your party with spellbooks, maps, and quick rulings.

It ingests:

- 📜 Rulebooks and compendia for the chosen system
- 🗺️ Campaign text, images, and maps
- 🧙‍♂️ Party character sheets and DM notes

It then assists the DM in **three stages**:

1. **Overall Campaign Preparation**
   Build a structured understanding of rules, world, factions, NPCs, and party backstories, including house rules and table conventions.

2. **Per-Session Preparation**
   Generate session recaps, surface unresolved hooks, design encounters and scenes, and check continuity.

3. **Real-Time Session Assistance**
   Provide fast, rules-aware, context-aware support during play (rules lookups, improv NPCs, continuity reminders, pacing suggestions) with low latency and high reliability.

The DMA is *not* meant to replace the DM. It acts as a quiet, knowledgeable assistant that:

- 🧭 Knows the rules and the campaign
- 📂 Helps with organization and prep
- 🎭 Supports improvisation and consistency during sessions
- ⚡ Minimizes latency and API costs

## ✨ High-Level Features

At maturity, the DMA should support:

- **Rules Engine (RAG-based)** 🧾
  - Ingest rulebooks and compendia
  - Answer rules questions with citations and “strict mode” (no hallucinations when unsure)

- **Campaign Model** 🏰
  - Structured representation of locations, NPCs, factions, timelines, secrets, and world state
  - Party and PC backstory integration

- **Prep Tools** 📓
  - Session recaps based on logs/notes
  - Suggest likely player directions and prepare branches
  - Encounter and scene generation, tuned to party and campaign tone
  - Consistency checks and hook surfacing

- **Live Session Tools** 🗡️
  - Fast rules lookups and rulings consistent with house rules
  - On-the-fly NPCs, descriptions, rumors, and small encounters
  - Continuity and name recall (“What was the innkeeper’s name?”)
  - Pacing and tension suggestions

## 🛠️ Development Approach

This repository is designed to be compatible with human developers and coding agents (e.g., OpenAI’s coding agent “Codex”). The **docs** directory contains:

- A clear functional spec  
- Non-functional requirements (cost, UX, reliability, latency, privacy)  
- Risks and mitigations  
- A phased roadmap  
- Testing, debugging, linting, benchmarking, and integration-testing guidelines per phase

## 🚪 Getting Started (for Developers / Agents)

1. Clone this repository into GitHub.
2. Decide on the primary implementation stack (e.g., Python backend + React frontend, or Node.js + VTT plugin).
3. Implement the roadmap phases in order:
   - Phase 1: Rules Engine & RAG
   - Phase 2: Campaign and Party Modeling
   - Phase 3: Prep Assistant
   - Phase 4: Real-Time Session Assistant
   - Phase 5: Hardening & Polish
4. After each phase, follow the relevant testing and QA steps in [`docs/06-testing-and-quality.md`](docs/06-testing-and-quality.md).

## 🔌 MapTool integration

The backend includes an adapter for syncing map state with MapTool. Configure the base URL and credentials via environment variables (`MAPTOOL_BASE_URL`, `MAPTOOL_USERNAME`, `MAPTOOL_PASSWORD`, `MAPTOOL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `MAPTOOL_MAX_RETRIES`) and use the `/api/maptool` routes to pull map state or push token updates. See [`docs/maptool-sync.md`](docs/maptool-sync.md) for details.
